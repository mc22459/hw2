Assignment:
Begin working on a small form (less than 6cm in its biggest direction). Bring .scad file to class next week. 
You will have time to work on your forms in class, but printing priority goes to those with finished models.

Decided to make a structure that would rely heavily on automatically generated supports. 
I wanted to test the printer to see its capabilities.
